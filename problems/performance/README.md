# Performance Problems

This directory contains problems related to:
- Slow queries
- Memory optimization
- Load balancing
- Caching solutions
- Resource utilization
- Bottleneck identification

Use the problem template when adding new performance issues.

## Example Problems to Document

- "API response time over 5 seconds"
- "Memory usage increasing over time"
- "Database queries causing high CPU"
- "Cache hit ratio below 80%"
- "Page load time exceeding 3 seconds"

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive filenames with dates:
- `2024-09-15-api-response-time-slow.md`
- `2024-09-14-memory-leak-investigation.md`
- `2024-09-13-database-cpu-optimization.md`

## Performance Metrics to Include

When documenting performance problems, include:
- Before/after metrics
- Specific measurements (response time, memory usage, etc.)
- Load conditions when problem occurred
- Performance benchmarks
