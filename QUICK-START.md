# Quick Start Workflow üöÄ

## When You Encounter a Problem

### Step 1: Search First! üîç
Before documenting a new problem, always search for existing solutions:

```bash
# Search GitHub repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/Salwan-Mohamed/solved-problems-reference
2. Use the search bar with keywords from your error
3. Check the problems/INDEX.md file
4. Browse the relevant category folder
```

### Step 2: Document the Problem üìù
If no solution exists, create a new problem document:

```bash
# 1. Choose the right category
- problems/development/     # Code, build, API issues
- problems/infrastructure/  # Servers, Docker, CI/CD  
- problems/database/       # DB queries, connections, performance
- problems/security/       # Vulnerabilities, auth, permissions
- problems/performance/    # Slow queries, memory, optimization
- problems/misc/          # Everything else

# 2. Copy the template
cp templates/problem-template.md problems/[category]/YYYY-MM-DD-problem-name.md

# 3. Fill out all sections
- Problem summary
- Environment details  
- Error messages/logs
- Investigation steps
- Solution details
- Testing verification
- Prevention measures
```

### Step 3: Name Your File üìÑ
Use this naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-problem-name.md

Examples:
2024-09-15-docker-container-startup-failure.md
2024-09-14-postgresql-slow-query-optimization.md  
2024-09-13-react-state-update-rendering-issue.md
```

### Step 4: Update the Index üìä
Add your problem to `problems/INDEX.md`:

```markdown
| 2024-09-15 | Docker container startup failure | Infrastructure | High | Solved | 45 min |
```

### Step 5: Add Tags üè∑Ô∏è
Include relevant tags in your problem document:
- `severity-critical/high/medium/low`
- `environment-production/staging/development`  
- `quick-fix` or `complex-solution`
- Technology tags: `docker`, `postgresql`, `react`, etc.

## Search Tips for Future Reference

### Finding Your Solution Later
```bash
# Search by error message
\"Module not found\" docker

# Search by category  
path:problems/database/ connection

# Search by tags
quick-fix severity-high

# Search by date range
created:>2024-09-01 path:problems/
```

### Most Useful Search Patterns
1. **Exact error messages** (in quotes)
2. **Technology + symptom** (docker startup, postgres slow)
3. **Category browsing** (check folder first)
4. **Tag filtering** (quick-fix for fast solutions)

## Time-Saving Benefits üïê

### Before This Repository
- Spend 2-4 hours re-investigating same problem
- Ask team members who might remember  
- Search through Slack history and emails
- Trial and error with old solutions

### After This Repository  
- Find solution in 2-5 minutes with search
- Copy/paste working solution  
- Reference exact steps that worked before
- Learn from prevention measures implemented

**Goal**: Never solve the same problem twice!

## Repository Maintenance üîß

### Weekly Review
- Check for new problems added
- Update INDEX.md summary
- Review most common problem types
- Identify patterns for prevention

### Monthly Analysis  
- Calculate time saved
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Update search optimization
- Review and improve templates

**Remember**: The 15 minutes you spend documenting a solution could save hours for your future self and teammates! üí°
